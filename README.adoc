Snapshot: image:https://circleci.com/gh/fulcrologic/fulcro-spec/tree/develop.svg?style=svg["CircleCI", link="https://circleci.com/gh/fulcrologic/fulcro-spec/tree/develop"]

== Super Quick Start

Use the fulcro lein template to get a project with CLJ tests, CLJS tests, and CI testing already configured and
set to go with:

```
lein new fulcro my-project
```

The resulting project's README has instructions for running the parts.

== Usage

* Make sure your link:https://clojure.org/community/downloads[clojure](link:https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/releases[script]) versions are at or above "1.9.x".

* Add `[fulcrologic/fulcro-spec "x.y.z"]` to your `:dependencies`.

* Make sure you have at least one test file, eg: `test/your-ns/arithmetic_spec.cljc`, that uses `fulcro-spec.core`:

[source]
----
(ns your-ns.arithmetic-spec
  (:require
    [fulcro-spec.core :refer [specification behavior component assertions]]))

(specification "arithmetic"
  (component "addition"
    (behavior "is commutative"
      (assertions
        (+ 13 42) => (+ 42 13)))))
----

=== Clojure In The Terminal

* Add `[com.jakemccrary/lein-test-refresh "x.y.z"]` to your `:plugins`.
** Check link:https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh#usage[lein test refresh itself] for the latest version.
* Add the following to your `project.clj` configuration:

    :test-refresh {:report fulcro-spec.reporters.terminal/fulcro-report}

[NOTE]
====
Other configuration options are available, take a look at:

* link:https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh/blob/master/sample.project.clj[].
* link:https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh/blob/master/test-refresh/src/leiningen/test_refresh.clj[].
====

* Run `lein test-refresh` in your command-line, et voila! You should see something like:

----
Using reporter: fulcro-spec.reporters.terminal/fulcro-report
*********************************************
*************** Running tests ***************
:reloading (your-ns.arithmetic-spec)
Running tests for: (your-ns.arithmetic-spec)

Testing your-ns.arithmetic-spec
   addition
     is commutative

Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.

Failed 0 of 1 assertions
Finished at 17:32:43.925 (run time: 0.01s)
----

TIP: Make sure you make the test fail to check that error reporting is working before moving on to another section.

[WARNING]
====

    Error refreshing environment: java.io.FileNotFoundException: Could not locate clojure/spec__init.class or clojure/spec.clj on classpath.

Make sure you have link:https://clojure.org/community/downloads[clojure](link:https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/releases[script]) versions above "1.9.x".
====

[WARNING]
====

    Error refreshing environment: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: clj does not exist, compiling:(fulcro_spec/watch.clj:1:1)

Add an `:exclusions [org.clojure/tools.namespace]` for tools.namespace on lein-test-refresh +
(and any other projects that use it, which you can check using `lein deps :tree` or `boot -pd`), +
as fulcro-spec requires "0.3.x" for clojurescript support, but lein-test-refresh doesn't need that itself.
====

=== Clojure In The Browser

* Create a `dev/clj/user.clj` file that contains:

[source]
----
(ns clj.user
  (:require
    [fulcro-spec.selectors :as sel]
    [fulcro-spec.suite :as suite])

(suite/def-test-suite my-test-suite
  {:config {:port 8888} ;;<2>
   :test-paths ["test"]
   :source-paths ["src"]}
  {:available #{:focused :unit :integration}
   :default #{::sel/none :focused :unit}})

(my-test-suite) ;;<1>
----
<1> Starts the test suite, note that it will stop any pre-existing test suite first, so it's safe to call this whenever (eg: hot code reload).
<2> You can now goto link:localhost:8888/fulcro-spec-server-tests.html[]

//DIVIDER WHY OH WHY
* Make sure the `"dev"` folder is in your `:source-paths`, if you are using lein that's probably just a `:profiles {:dev {:source-paths ["dev"]}}`.
* Add `clj.user` to your `:repl-options {:init-ns clj.user}`, which again if using lein probably goes in your `:profiles {:dev #_...}`

=== CLJS In The Browser

* Add `[figwheel-sidecar "x.y.z"]` to your `dev` time dependencies (link:https://clojars.org/lein-figwheel[latest releases]).
** Add `[com.cemerick/piggieback "x.y.z"]` to your `dev` time dependencies (link:https://clojars.org/com.cemerick/piggieback[latest version]).
** Add `:nrepl-middleware [cemerick.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl]` to your `:repl-options`.
* Add `[org.clojure/clojurescript "x.y.z"]` as a normal dependencies (link:https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/releases[latest releases]).

* Add to your `/dev/clj/user.clj`:

[source]
----
(:require
  [com.stuartsierra.component :as cp]
  [figwheel-sidecar.system :as fsys]
  #_...)

(defn start-figwheel [build-ids]
  (-> (fsys/fetch-config)
    (assoc-in [:data :build-ids] build-ids)
    fsys/figwheel-system cp/start fsys/cljs-repl))
----

* Create a `/dev/cljs/user.cljs`

[source]
----
(ns cljs.user
  (:require
    your-ns.arithmetic-spec ;;<1>
    [fulcro-spec.selectors :as sel]
    [fulcro-spec.suite :as suite]))

(suite/def-test-suite on-load {:ns-regex #"your-ns\..*-spec"} ;;<2>
  {:default #{::sel/none :focused}
   :available #{:focused :should-fail}})
----
<1> Ensures your tests are loaded so the test suite can find them
<2> Regex for finding just your tests from all the loaded namespaces.

* (Optional) Create an HTML file for loading your tests in your `resources/public` folder. If you're using
the standard figwheel config, then you can also choose to load one that is
provided in the JAR of Fulcro Spec.

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link href="css/fulcro-spec-styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
        <link href="css/fulcro-ui.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

        <div id="fulcro-spec-report">Loading "js/test/test.js", if you need to name that something else (conflicts?) make your own test html file</div>
        <script src="js/test/test.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </body>
</html>
----

The HTML above is exactly the content of the built-in file
`fulcro-spec-client-tests.html`.

//DIVIDER WHY OH WHY
* Add `[lein-cljsbuild "x.y.z"]` as a `:plugin` (link:https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild#latest-version[latest version]).
* Add a `:cljsbuild` for your tests (link:https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild#basic-configuration[basic configuration]), eg:

[source]
----
:cljsbuild {:builds [

{:id "test"
 :source-paths ["src" "dev" "test"]
 :figwheel     {:on-jsload cljs.user/on-load}
 :compiler     {:main          cljs.user
                :output-to     "resources/public/js/test/test.js"
                :output-dir    "resources/public/js/test/out"
                :asset-path    "js/test/out"
                :optimizations :none}}

]}
----

    lein repl
    #_=> (start-figwheel ["test"])

[WARNING]
====
    java.lang.RuntimeException: No such var: om/dispatch, compiling:(fulcro/client/mutations.cljc:8:1)

Means you have a conflicting org.omcljs/om versions, either resolve them by looking at `lein deps :tree` or `bood -pd`, or pin your version to the link:https://github.com/omcljs/om/releases[latest version] or whatever version fulcro-spec is using.
====

* Run the tests by loading your HTML file (or the one provided in the Fulcro Spec JAR). The default figwheel
port is 3449, so the URL that should always work by default if you've named your
javascript output `js/test/test.js` would be: link:http://localhost:3449/fulcro-spec-client-tests.html[]

== Focusing in on Tests

Fulcro Spec allows you to tag specifications with arbitrary keywords that you define, and allows you to specify which of
those are in your "default" set. This can allow you to separate integration tests, or simply focus in on the test you're
working on.

```
(specification "My Test" :focused
   ...)
``` 

The selectors configuration shown earlier (`:default` and `:available`) are where you define which ones you start out
with. The special keyword `::sel/none` is for tests that have no tag. The browser-based UI will let you choose the 
selectors to run from the pull out menu in the upper-left corner.

==== For CI

* Add lein-doo as both a test dependency and a plugin

    :dependencies [#_... [lein-doo "0.1.6" :scope "test"] #_...]
    :plugins [#_... [lein-doo "0.1.6"] #_...]

* Add a `:doo` section to your project.clj

    :doo {:build "automated-tests"
          :paths {:karma "node_modules/karma/bin/karma"}}

* Add a top level `package.json` containing at least:

    {
      "devDependencies": {
        "karma": "^0.13.19",
        "karma-chrome-launcher": "^2.2.0",
        "karma-firefox-launcher": "^0.1.7",
        "karma-cljs-test": "^0.1.0"
      }
    }

* Add a `:cljsbuild` for your CI tests, eg:

[source]
----
:cljsbuild {:builds [

{:id "automated-tests"
 :source-paths ["src" "test"]
 :compiler     {:output-to     "resources/private/js/unit-tests.js"
                :output-dir    "resources/private/js/unit-tests"
                :asset-path    "js/unit-tests"
                :main          fulcro-spec.all-tests
                :optimizations :none}}

]}
----

* Add a file that runs your tests

[source]
----
(ns your-ns.all-tests
  (:require
    your-ns.arithmetic-spec ;; ensures tests are loaded so doo can find them
    [doo.runner :refer-macros [doo-all-tests]]))

(doo-all-tests #"fulcro-spec\..*-spec")
----

* Run `npm install` & then `lein doo chrome automated-tests once`, +

NOTE: If you put the `automated-tests` build in a lein profile (eg: test), +
you will have to prepend a `with-profile test ...` in your command.

* See link:http://github.com/bensu/doo#doo[doo] itself for further details & as a fallback if this information is somehow out of date.
